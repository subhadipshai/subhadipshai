                    What is web design?
                    Many young or new designers often misunderstand the concept of web design. Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather than software development. Therefore, even someone without any technical knowledge can become a great web designer using platforms like Mockplus, Figma or Sketch. Of course, it would be great if you know some coding language (HTML, CSS, Java), but you can’t get yourself deep into front-end development, that’s not the core of web design. The core of web design is visual and interaction. It aims to solve the communication problems between users and web page information.
                    
                    What skills do web designers need to have?
                    As young designers, you may feel confused about what skills to master when you start your career. In this part, we will explore the top skills that a young web designer must have. Now, let’s dive in.
                    
                    Master the basic rules of visual design
                    Simply speaking, visual design is the process of improving the UI and UX of a web/app through visual elements and effects, including colors, illustrations, photography, typography, layouts, white spaces and the like. In contrast to UI design, it focuses more heavily on the visual effects of web/app design and aims to engage users. As beginners, if you want to have a great visual design, you need to bear the basic principles of scale, visual hierarchy, balance, contrast and gestalt in mind, which can help you to drive engagement and increase usability.
                    
                    
                    To learn layout design
                    Layout design is the process of arranging visual elements — like text, images, and shapes — on a given page. Layout design is critically important for website design, because it can determine the overall appearance and the connection among graphic elements on the page to achieve a smooth message flow to maximize performance.
                    
                    To learn the color principles
                    Different color combinations on a given page can offer varying experiences and visual contrasts for the visitor, making it a critical component for website design. Do bear the basic principles of color, which can help you create effective color schemes for your website.
                    
                    To master the basic knowledge of interaction design
                    Interaction design is about creating engaging interfaces with well-thought-out behaviors. For web designers, you need to have basic knowledge about interaction design, like creating design strategies, identifying key wireframe interactions, and prototype interactions, which can help you to create a user-friendly experience for your visitors.
                    
                    To learn to use a prototyping and design tool
                    There are many prototyping and design tools for you to choose to create your website. As beginners, you need to choose one like Mockplus that is easy to use and offers you various built-in components,which can help you quickly get a first visual impression of your future website. With Mockplus, you don’t have to wait for the final screen design and instead you can validate your ideas within minutes.
                    
                    
                    To understand the basic coding language(HTML, CSS)
                    As it’s stated above, web design is not about software development and you do not have to get yourself deep into front-end development. But as a designer, having basic programming knowledge allows you to collaborate with developers more efficiently. Here we have some best and free online websites for beginners to learn coding.
                    
                    Be familiar with your company product and the user group
                    No matter if you are a beginner or a professional designer, the purpose of your design is to present the value of your product or business to your customers. So the last but least skill for a designer is to have a clear persona and create a design that meets your customers’ needs.
                    
                    The five basic elements of web design
                    After you master all the skills above, it’s time to turn the page on that sketchbook and start your web design. Here are five basic design elements you’ll want to make sure you get it right.
                    
                    Overall layout
                    The overall look of your website is a crucial component of web design. Studies find that
                    
                    users take only 50 milliseconds to form an opinion of your website or business, and that will determine whether they’ll stay or leave. Therefore, you need to keep your design simple, clean and accessible, and at the same time, use grid-based designs to keep design items organized and orderly, thus creating a great overall layout.
                    
                    Color scheme
                    The color palette and fonts on your site will directly inform your visitors’ opinions of your site and are what most novice designers start with.<br><br>1. Wondering what color scheme to choose? Just turn to your brand or industry perspectives — along with your target audience demographics — will help to save your workload and make this a somewhat painless process.
                    
                    Typography
                    Speaking of typography or font design, you need to make your text easily readable, which generally means the body copy should be at least 16 pixels. It is ideal to use a complementary font for headings or accents, but do not go beyond three typefaces or unnecessary sizing adjustments.
                    
                    
                    Navigation
                    Navigation plays an integral role in how users interact with and use your site or products.
                    
                    Navigation design is the discipline of creating, analyzing and implementing ways for users to navigate through a website or app. Just take some time to place your navigational elements at the right place on your site, you can make it exist in a site’s header, body, and footer, but simply serve to direct your visitors to the information they desire as quickly as possible.
                    
                    Content
                    After you got the layout, color scheme, typefaces, and navigation design, now you need to add content to your site to make it trustworthy and capable of delivering top-notch products and services. Efficiency is key, as extra words can stand in the way and dull your brand’s primary selling points. So just think short and sweet to make your content organized and informative.
