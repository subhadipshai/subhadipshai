                <h3>What Is a Full Stack Web Developer?</h3>
                <p>Full stack developers are experts in the “full stack” of website-related technologies. 
                  If you’re wondering how long it takes to become a full stack developer, don’t worry;
                  stepping into this versatile role is easier than you might think. With a full-time bootcamp, 
                  dedicated tech enthusiasts can accumulate job-ready skills in as little as three to six months.
                   That said, those who prefer the comprehensiveness a formal degree provides should be prepared 
                   to set aside four or more years for their education. </p>
                  <h3>Learn the Foundations of Front End Development</h3>
                <p>Front end developers determine how a website looks when loaded on the client side. They’re responsible 
                for creating and designing all user-facing website elements. Below, we’ve listed the languages all aspiring 
                front end developers will need to know before landing their first job. 
            <br><br>HTML
            <br><br>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) allows coders to define a website’s basic structure and design. An HTML file tells a browser what to display on a device’s screen and how elements like paragraphs, lists and images are arranged. 
            HTML is very accessible and can provide an excellent introduction for people who are new to coding. It’s a critical part of a web developer’s toolkit and acts as a jumping-off point for all websites. Modern websites utilize powerful scripting languages like JavaScript to create dynamic web content. However, even though it’s a much older technology, HTML is still at the core of these websites.   
            Want more information on this “building block” coding language? Here’s a guide to learning HTML.
            <br><br>CSS 
            <br><br> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) changes how HTML elements are displayed on a screen. Understanding CSS allows you to create great looking web pages across all major browsers. You can change a page’s layout, colors and fonts, as well as add effects to page elements. 
            CSS is used in combination with HTML to create and style web pages. It’s easy to learn and understand, but it also has a lot of depth. CSS gives you a lot of control over how an HTML document is presented to the user — as such, learning CSS is crucial for anyone looking to create beautiful and responsive websites
            <br><br>JavaScript
            <br><br>JavaScript is another critical component in a front end web developer’s toolbox. It’s one of the most popular languages on the market according to HackerRank’s 2020 Developer report (PDF, 2.8MB), and the #1 most requested language by hiring managers.
            JavaScript is a client-side language that is used alongside HTML and CSS to create dynamic, responsive websites. It’s easy to pick up and incredibly versatile, allowing a developer to handle any part of a website’s design and functionality. Many of the skills involved with writing JavaScript can also be applied to other languages like Python and Java, making it an excellent introduction to coding.
